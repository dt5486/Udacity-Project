	<h1 class="title">What a Web Page is</h1>
		<div class="image"><img src="Images/www.png"></img></div>
		<div class="description"><p>A web page is a text document written in a language called
		HTML.  Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
		</div>
	<h2 class="title2">How Coding Works</h2>
		<div class="description2"></div><p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language
		that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the intructions the
		programmer wrote.</p>
		<p>For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:<br>
		<span style="COLOR: blue">I'm</span>
		<span style="COLOR: blue">&lt;b&gt;</span>
		<span style="COLOR: blue">learning;</span>
		<span style="COLOR: blue">&lt;b&gt;</span>
		<span style="COLOR: blue">to code!</span><br>
		</p>
		look like this:<br>
		<span style="COLOR: blue">I'm <b>learning</b> to code!</span>
		</div>
	<h2 class="title3">Computers are stupid</h2>
		<div class="discription3"><p>Programmers need to write <i>exactly</i> the way a
		computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").</p><p>For example.  If you
		forget to close a &lt;b&gt; tag, then computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended
		to make bold.  This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible
		power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.</p>
		</div>
	<h2 class="title4">Programmers Can't Remember Everything</h2>
		<div class="discription4"><p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head.  And thats's
		okay.  If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.</p></div>
	<h2 class="title5">Basic HTML Vocabulary</h2>
		<div class="discription5"><p>An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have an opening
		tag ( &lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag ( &lt;/p&gt; ).  Some tages (called "void" tags) do not require
		a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag).  An <b>Element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
		 An <b>Attribute</b> is a property of an HTML elemnt.  For example, to set the <span style="COLOR: red">href</span>
		attribute of an achor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write
		<span style="COLOR: red">&lt;a</span>
		<span style="COLOR: red">href="www.udacity.com"&gt</span></p></div>
