		<h2 class="title1">How Coding Works</h2>
			<div class="description"></div><p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language
			that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the intructions the
			programmer wrote.</p>
			<p>For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:<br>
			<span style="COLOR: blue">I'm</span>
			<span style="COLOR: blue">&lt;b&gt;</span>
			<span style="COLOR: blue">learning;</span>
			<span style="COLOR: blue">&lt;b&gt;</span>
			<span style="COLOR: blue">to code!</span><br>
			</p>
			look like this:<br>
			<span style="COLOR: blue">I'm <b>learning</b> to code!</span>
		<h2 class="title1">Computers are stupid</h2>
			<div class="discription"><p>Programmers need to write <i>exactly</i> the way a
			computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").</p><p>For example.  If you
			forget to close a &lt;b&gt; tag, then computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended
			to make bold.  This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible
			power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.</p>

            The phrase "computers are stupid" refers to how they interpret instructions literally. This means that small typos can cause big problems.

		<h2 class="title1">Avoid Repetition</h2>
			<div class="discription"><p>By avoiding duplication in a structured HTML file you are able to make
			changes to more obects easier.  CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from
			document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
			content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
			enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
			complexity and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely used
			to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate
			presentation instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each
			matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that
			"all heading 1 elements should be bold," leaving pure semantic HTML markup that asserts "this text is a level 1 heading
			" without formatting code such as a bold tag indicating how such text should be displayed.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Programmers Can't Remember Everything</h2>
			<div class="discription"><p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head.  And thats's
			okay.  If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h2>
			<div class="discription"><p>The "tree-like scructure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have
			other elements inside them.  You can draw this relationship like a family tree.</p><p>In a browser,
			this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes.  There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Basic HTML Vocabulary</h2>
			<div class="discription"><p>An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have an opening
			tag ( &lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag ( &lt;/p&gt; ).  Some tages (called "void" tags) do not require
			a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag).  An <b>Element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
			An <b>Attribute</b> is a property of an HTML elemnt.  For example, to set the <span style="COLOR: red">href</span>
			attribute of an achor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write
			<span style="COLOR: red">&lt;a</span>
			<span style="COLOR: red">href="www.udacity.com"&gt;</span></p>

		<h2 class="title1">CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
			<div class="discription"><p><b>CSS</b> is a way for Web developers to define the look and feel of their Web pages.
			Style sheet refers to the document itself.  They are the technical specifications for a layout with the functionality of telling
			the Web browser how to render the document being viewed. The cascade is what makes CSS style sheets so useful. In short, the cascade
			defines the order of precedence for how conflicting styles should be applied. </p></div>
