	<h1 class="title">What a Web Page is</h1>
		<div class="image"><img src="images/www.png" alt="picture"></div>
		<div class="image_description"><p>A web page is a text document written in a language called
		HTML.  Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 class="title1">How Coding Works</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language
			that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the intructions the
			programmer wrote.</p>
			<p>For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:<br>
			<div class="blue">I'm&lt;b&gt;learning;&lt;b&gt;to code!</div>
			look like this:<br><div class="blue">I'm <b>learning</b> to code!</div></p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Computers are stupid</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>Programmers need to write <i>exactly</i> the way a
			computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").</p><p>For example.  If you
			forget to close a &lt;b&gt; tag, then computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended
			to make bold.  This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible
			power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it to do anything you want.<br>
			<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b><br>The phrase "computers are stupid" refers to how they interpret
			instructions literally. This means that small typos can cause big problems.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Avoid Repetition</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>By avoiding duplication in a structured HTML file you are able to make
			changes to more obects easier.  CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from
			document presentation, including elements such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
			content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
			enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
			complexity and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that were widely used
			to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate
			presentation instructions from the HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each
			matching HTML element, it provides a list of formatting instructions. For example, a CSS rule might specify that
			"all heading 1 elements should be bold," leaving pure semantic HTML markup that asserts "this text is a level 1 heading
			" without formatting code such as a bold tag indicating how such text should be displayed.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Programmers Can't Remember Everything</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head.  And thats's
			okay.  If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>The "tree-like scructure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have
			other elements inside them.  You can draw this relationship like a family tree.</p><p>In a browser,
			this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes.  There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Basic HTML Vocabulary</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have an opening
			tag ( &lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag ( &lt;/p&gt; ).  Some tages (called "void" tags) do not require
			a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag).  An <b>Element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
			An <b>Attribute</b> is a property of an HTML elemnt.  For example, to set the <div class="red">href</div>
			attribute of an achor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write<div class="red">&lt;a href="www.udacity.com"&gt;</div><br>

			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
			<div class="description"><p><b>CSS</b> is a way for Web developers to define the look and feel of their Web pages.
			Style sheet refers to the document itself.  They are the technical specifications for a layout with the functionality of telling
			the Web browser how to render the document being viewed. The cascade is what makes CSS style sheets so useful. In short, the cascade
			defines the order of precedence for how conflicting styles should be applied. </p></div>
            </div>
		<h2 class="title1">Serious Programming </h2>
			<div class="description"><p>A computer can be <b>programmed</b> to do anything we want, as lng as we can write a program that specifies
			a <i>specific sequence of instructions</i>. A program is a precise sequence of steps that a computer can follow to do something useful.
			Web browsers, games, mobile apps, and simple print statements are all examples of computer programs. A <b>Programming Language</b> is what
			programmers use to tell a computer what to do.  <i><b>Python</b></i> is one example of a programming language.</p><p>When you write Python
			code press "Run", a <i>Python Interpreter</i> converts the code you wrote as a set of instuctions that the computer itself can understand
			and execute.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Variables and Srings What is a <b>variable</b> in Python? </h2>
			<div class="description"><p>In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the
			program. Typically, a program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.
			Variables give programmers a way to give <i>names</i> to values. For example <b>my_variables</b> is a variable with the value of <b>2</b>,
			then the following code would print out <b>4</b>:<br> <b>print my_variable + my_variable</b></p><p>In computer programming, a string is
			traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be
			mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Input -> Function -> Output </h2>
			<div class="description"><p>A function is something that takes input, does something to that input, and then produces output.  For example,
			a function named <b>square</b> might take a number as input and produce the square of that number as output.  Functions are made by stating a
			line of code with the <b>def</b> and then giving a function namefollowed by the function <b>parameter</b> in parentthesis.  These parameters
			will eventually be replaced by the actual values when the function is used.</p><p>In the "body" of the function, we write code that specifies
			what to do with the input parameters.  For example the following code could be the definition of a function called <b>square</b>:<br>def
			square(x): <br> answer = x + x <br> return answer</p>
			</div>
		 <h2 class="title1">Automate You Page </h2>
			<div class="description"><p>Will be understanding how to use existing code to expand on my own code to make it more powerful.  Object-oriented
			programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "<i><b>actions</b></i>" and data rather than logic.  An
			<b>Object</b> are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from
			the process.  In between, each object is made into a generic class of object and even more generic classes are defined so that objects can share
			models and reuse the class definitions in their code. Each object is an instance of a particular <i><b>class</b></i> or <i><b>subclass</b></i>
			with the class own methods or procedures and data variables. A <b>class</b> is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular
			kind of object.  Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.</p><p>The class is one of the
			defining ideas of object-oriented programming. Among the important ideas about classes are:<br><b>-</b> A class can have subclasses that can inherit
			all or some of the characteristics of the class.<br><b>-</b>  Subclasses can also define their own methods and variables that are not part of their
			superclass.<br><b>-</b>   The structure of a class and its subclasses is called the class hierarchy.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">The value of <b>OOP</b></h2>
			<div class="description"><p>Object-Oriented Programming has the following advantages:<br><b>-</b>  OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs
			which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes where implementation details are hidden and the unit has a clearly defined interface.<br><b>-</b>  OOP
			makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.<br><b>-</b>  OOP provides a good
			framework for code libraries where supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Python Standard Library </h2>
			<div class="description"><p>The Python Standard Library contains hundreds of modules that provide tools for interacting with the operating system, interpreter,
			and Internet. It imports useful operations for basic support modules; operating system interfaces; network protocols; file formats; data conversions; threads
			and processes; and data storage</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Class and Instance</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>class variables are defined outside of any method of the class, normally right below the doc string.  Class variables can be referenced
			directly from the class, and this can be used as one way to make an enumerated constant, or they can be referenced from any instance in the class.  Instance variables
			are defined inside a method, normally __new__ or __init__, and they are local to that instance.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Constructor</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>A <b>constructor</b> (abbreviation: ctor) in a class is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object
			for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.</p><p>A constructor resembles an instance method, but it differs from a
			method in that it has no explicit return type, it is not implicitly inherited and it usually has different rules for scope modifiers. Constructors often have the same
			name as the declaring class. They have the task of initializing the objects data members and of establishing the invariant of the class, failing if the invariant is invalid.
			A properly written constructor leaves the resulting object in a valid state. Immutable objects must be initialized in a constructor.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Self</h2>
			<div class="description"><p><b>Self</b> is used/needed to distinguish between instances. In the __init__ method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods,
			it refers to the instance whose method was called.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Method Overriding </h2>
			<div class="description"><p><b>Overriding</b> is a very important part of OOP since it is the feature that makes inheritance exploit its full power.  Through method overriding a class
			may "copy" another class, avoiding duplicated code, and at the same time enhance or customize part of it. Method overriding is thus a strict part of the inheritance mechanism.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Power of Abstraction</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>Abstracting something means to give names to things, so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does.  In programming, abstractions
			are defined as functions (and some other constructs like classes and modules)  A function essentially names a set of single statements, so a function essentially is an abstraction.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Introduction to Networks</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>The internet is what's called a <b>"NETWORK"</b><br>A <b>NETWORK</b> is a group of entities that can communicate, even though they are not all directly connected.
			<br>Terms used in reference to this are:<br>Latency - Which is time it takes a message to get from source to destination.<br><div class="green">milliseconds</div><br>Bandwidth - Which is the amount
			of info that can be transmitted per unit time.<br><div class="green">bit per second</div><br>Bit - Which is the smallest unit of information.<br>Protocol - Which uses a set of rules to send and receive
			messages at the Internet address level.<br><b>HTTPS</b> which means <b>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure</b> is a type of protocol ex: https://www.google.com<br>Messages between a client(like a web browser)
			and a Server(like google.com).  The client does a <b>GET</b> to the server and it <b>RESPONDS</b> with the content.  Thier are two types of servers <b>Static</b> which is a pre-written file image and <b>Dynamic
			</b> which is made on the fly (web applications)</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title">More on Servers</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>1) In information technology, a server is a computer program that provides services to other computer programs (and their users) in the same or other computers.<br>
			2) The computer that a server program runs in is also frequently referred to as a server (though it may be used for other purposes as well).<br>3) In the client/server programming model, a server is a program
			that awaits and fulfills requests from client programs in the same or other computers. A given application in a computer may function as a client with requests for services from other programs and also as a
			server of requests from other programs.<br>Specific to the Web, a Web server is the computer program (housed in a computer) that serves requested HTML pages or files. A Web client is the requesting program
			associated with the user. The Web browser in your computer is a client that requests HTML files from Web servers.</p>

			<div class="green">Internet: best effort service</div></p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">Forms</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>n a database context, a form is a window or screen that contains numerous fields, or spaces to enter data. Each field holds a field label so that any user who views the form gets an idea of
			its contents. A form is more user friendly than generating queries to create tables and insert data into fields.  You can use <b>Strings, List or Dictionary</b>.</p></div>
		<h2 class="title1">Validation</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>A server can recieve junk.  This can cause damage to a wesite if the appropriate actions are taken.  By verifying the users input this can ensure valid input is given.  String substitution
			can be used so that information that is submitted will not corrupt any data.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 class="title1">GET vs POST</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>The POST request method is designed to request that a web server accepts the data enclosed in the request message's body for storage. It is often used when uploading a file or submitting a
			completed web form. In contrast, the HTTP GET request method is designed to retrieve information from the server.<br><b>GET</b><br>-parameters in URL<br>-used for fetching documents<br>-max URL length<br>-ok to cache
			<br><br><b>POST</b><br>-parameters in body<br>-used for updating data<br>-no max lenght<br>-not ok to cache<br>-ok to change the server</p>

			with a relational database.  <b>ACID</b> (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases, a single logical operation on
			the data is called a transaction.  </p></div>
		<h2 class="title1">What Are Responsive Images?</h2>
			<div class="description"><p>A responsive design is an approach that enables your website to fluidly adjust within the parameters of any device involving a minimum of scrolling or zooming. In other words, creating great-looking sites
			which are dynamic and flexible enough to be visually responsive to any screen, from mobile widths right up to desktop format.  While responsive images are now widely used and fairly easy to use in basic layouts, anyone designing more
			complicated sites will know that issues can quickly rear their ugly heads. Needless to say there is no one key to fit all locks, here are seven of the most common problems below, along with a basic run-through of effective techniques
			related to each problem.<br><b>What Are The Problems?</b><br>One major factor in the need for responsive images is overall website size Ð even today, a huge percentage of mobile-version sites are as large (or even larger) than their
			desktop versions, thereby affecting performance negatively. Images play a large part in this, as image quality and size in general continues to increase, but it makes little sense if the data is wasted by mobile devices or desktops with
			low bandwidth connection. So to improve efficiency, more designers now using responsive images however, these often open up their own cans of worms.<br>Scaling images down to better fit devices is the most common approach to making
			content responsive, but in many cases this can make the image less powerful the "art-direction problem". Other less aesthetic issues, such as processes which either don't 'validate' or aren't considered strictly semantic, can for some
			designers (or clients) be a stumbling block. Then there are the technical aspects to consider server-side components, use of JavaScript, bandwidth testing, and third-party options. All these issues have (more or less) great solutions.
			<br><b>Problem 1 Semantics</b><br><b>Problem 2 Art Direction</b><br><b>Problem 3 Validity</b><br><b>Problem 4 Bandwidth Capabilities</b><br><b>Problem 5 Server Side Components</b><br><b>Problem 6 JavaScript</b><br><b>Problem
			7 Third Parties</b></p></div>
